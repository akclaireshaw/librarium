[Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/what-we-do) is a hyper-converged infrastructure platform that combines storage, compute, and networking into a single integrated system. Palette provides a generic framework built upon the open-source CAPI initiative to support adding cloud providers. Using this framework, Palette supports integration with Nutanix as a *Tech Preview* for enabling cluster deployment within the Nutanix environment. This integration is achieved through a Private Cloud Gateway (PCG), which establishes a secure connection with Nutanix.
