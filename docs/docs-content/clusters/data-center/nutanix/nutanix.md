Palette enables seamless integration with Canonical MAAS, allowing you to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters directly on bare metal servers. Palette achieves this through the Private Cloud Gateway (PCG), establishing a secure connection from the internal network to the internet-accessible Palette instance and effectively bypassing NAT gateways and firewalls.


Palette also supports self-hosted deployment of Kubernetes clusters in the MAAS environment, allowing direct access to MAAS through a private network without the need for a PCG. This setup ensures network connectivity and flexibility in managing Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers, either through a VPN or by directly accessing the Palette instance in a private network.
