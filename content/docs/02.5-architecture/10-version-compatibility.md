# Overview

Palette's product versioning schema follows the traditional software version format of X.Y.Z. This number system is used to track the different releases of the product, and the individual numbers indicate significant changes in the software's development. 

The first number represents the product's major version and is incremented when a major change with breaking compatibility is introduced. The second number is incremented when new features with backward compatibility are introduced, and the third number represents bug fixes and minor improvements with forward compatibility.


# Long Term Support (LTS)

Each major version of Palette will contiue to receive long term support for the next three calendar years, with the option to extend support up to one extra year.
